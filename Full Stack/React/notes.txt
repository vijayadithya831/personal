rest parameters/arguments => represent an indefinite number of parameters(it will pack arguements in to an array)

callbacks => a function call made inside a parameter of another function
             a function passed as an arguement to another function

             pros : it ensures that the function is not gonna execute before a task is completed
                    helps us to develop asynchronous code (when one function has to wait for another function)
                    helps us to avoid errors and some complex/potential problems


map (array.map) => executes a provided callback function once for each array element and creates a new array

Maps => it is an inbuilt object that hold key-value pairs of any datatype.
        keys should be unique, but values can have duplicates

        syntax : const store = new Map();

REACT ðŸ”¥

A Facebook and Instagram Collaboration 
initial release from 2013


React is not a framework, it is a library, used to create user interface

insta, fb, ebay, skype, bitbucket, etc is made up of React

WHY REACT JS??

* SEO friendly (Search Engine Optimization)
* Coding is simpler because of JSX (JavaScript XML language => HTML can be typed in js file)

Features of ReactJS

* Virtual DOM
* Unidirectional Data Flow

React Core Concepts

* JSX
* Components (v.v.v.v.v.v.v.v.v important)
* Virtual DOM
* Unidirectional Data Flow

React Components => Self-contained reusable building blocks of web application

React is a component based architecture => this will break down our application into small encapsulated parts which can be composed to make more complex UIs.

header, side navbar, content of the page, footer => individual components of a page => aka inner components or nested componenets

root component => this components holds all other inner components

Components => components is completely reusable code => which means for example, if we develop an article component in react, we can use that in angular, vue, etc.

React is completely declarative (imperative => antonym) => Tell react what we want and reacg will build the actual UI => This is implicit way

===========================================================================================================================================

to download react (prerequsites) => 1. node js
                                    2. browser
                                    3. vscode

Commands to create react application

1. npx create-react-app (my-app)

change directory => cd (my-app)

run react app => npm start

Components => In React, component represents a part of user interfaces.


components are categorised into two types =>1. Stateless Functional Components
                                            2. Stateful Class Components

                1. => JavaScript function
                eg. function Greetings(props) {
                    return <h1> Hello, {props.name} </h1>;
                }

                2. => Classes
                eg. class Greeting extends React.Component {
                    render() {
                        return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>
                    }
                }
