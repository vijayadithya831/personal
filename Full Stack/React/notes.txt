rest parameters/arguments => represent an indefinite number of parameters(it will pack arguements in to an array)

callbacks => a function call made inside a parameter of another function
             a function passed as an arguement to another function

             pros : it ensures that the function is not gonna execute before a task is completed
                    helps us to develop asynchronous code (when one function has to wait for another function)
                    helps us to avoid errors and some complex/potential problems


map (array.map) => executes a provided callback function once for each array element and creates a new array

Maps => it is an inbuilt object that hold key-value pairs of any datatype.
        keys should be unique, but values can have duplicates

        syntax : const store = new Map();
